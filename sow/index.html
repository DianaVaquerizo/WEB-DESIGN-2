       <p>Purpose talent is a consulting company dedicated to forming efficient and creative groups of people for different companies. I selected this website because the design perfectly conveys the brand values thanks to the entertaining animations and the visual style. The experience of entering feels extremely welcoming and the whole elements invite you to stay and learn more about the company.</p>

       <h3 class="3-analysis">‚Ä¢ Structure</h3>
       <p>The website has a simple yet efficient structure, despite the quantity of elements, the information has a concise composition that aims to be easy to understand. The top menu includes the essential amount of information for both clients and companies and the homepage focuses on explaining what Purpose Talent is through different sections. These sections include an about us with a ‚Äúcall to action‚Äù to learn more, an area with partners to gain the trust of possible clients and many different sections with information and values organized in an interactive and visual way. Elements are distributed dynamically, mixing powerful and animated with functionality.</p>

       <h3>‚Ä¢ Visual</h3>
       <p>Possibly, the most important aspect of this site is the visual style and the ideas it symbolizes. The branding includes a color palette that seems soft and friendly thanks to the use of desaturated shades and beige. As well as the color, the distressed bold typography for headings creates a welcoming effect due to the unseriousness of it. Nevertheless, what draws attention the most are the illustrations and animations. They are a representation of the concept and the core values of Purpose Talent. These illustrations show people working together in an open minded and inclusive context that makes the brand look more appealing.</p>

       <h3>‚Ä¢ Interaction</h3>
       <p>Additionally to the intriguing visual elements, the website includes animations and microinteraction as a way to captivate the user. The illustrated animations look extremely entertaining and as I have previously stated, they are essential to the values of the company. Thanks to the microinteractions the user feels included in the experience and they help guide the attention to different elements and sections of the website. This is the case when scrolling and different areas moving to seem like a welcoming and friendly website.</p>

       <h3>‚Ä¢ Usability</h3>
       <p>Purpose Talent‚Äôs website stands out for its visuals, nevertheless the usability still has been thought of. This can be seen in the clarity of the top menu having two complete separate sections for the different users who enter the page (companies or candidates). The contact button and the different ‚Äúcall to actions‚Äù, which are really important, have been designed with distinctive characteristics like different colors to add contrast. Additionally, the efficient division of sections with areas of more and less important information has been perfectly executed and adds to the readability of the page. One of the only downsides of the page is that when resizing the viewport, the loading page reappears, making the experience rather uncomfortable at certain points.</p>

       <h3>‚Ä¢ Technical</h3>
       <p>Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet, consectetur adipiscing elit. Integer a ante in metus rutrum finibus. Proin sodales, lorem at aliquet laoreet, tellus odio tincidunt felis, sed facilisis nisi sapien eget libero.</p>
