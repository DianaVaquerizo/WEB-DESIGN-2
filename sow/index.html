    <div class="analysis-text">
       <p>Purpose talent is a consulting company dedicated to forming efficient and creative groups of people for different companies. I selected this website because the design perfectly conveys the brand values thanks to the entertaining animations and the visual style. The experience of entering feels extremely welcoming and the whole elements invite you to stay and learn more about the company.</p>

       <h3 class="3-analysis">• Structure</h3>
       <p>The website has a simple yet efficient structure, despite the quantity of elements, the information has a concise composition that aims to be easy to understand. The top menu includes the essential amount of information for both clients and companies and the homepage focuses on explaining what Purpose Talent is through different sections. These sections include an about us with a “call to action” to learn more, an area with partners to gain the trust of possible clients and many different sections with information and values organized in an interactive and visual way. Elements are distributed dynamically, mixing powerful and animated with functionality.</p>

       <h3>• Visual</h3>
       <p>Possibly, the most important aspect of this site is the visual style and the ideas it symbolizes. The branding includes a color palette that seems soft and friendly thanks to the use of desaturated shades and beige. As well as the color, the distressed bold typography for headings creates a welcoming effect due to the unseriousness of it. Nevertheless, what draws attention the most are the illustrations and animations. They are a representation of the concept and the core values of Purpose Talent. These illustrations show people working together in an open minded and inclusive context that makes the brand look more appealing.</p>

       <h3>• Interaction</h3>
       <p>Additionally to the intriguing visual elements, the website includes animations and microinteraction as a way to captivate the user. The illustrated animations look extremely entertaining and as I have previously stated, they are essential to the values of the company. Thanks to the microinteractions the user feels included in the experience and they help guide the attention to different elements and sections of the website. This is the case when scrolling and different areas moving to seem like a welcoming and friendly website.</p>

       <h3>• Usability</h3>
       <p>Purpose Talent’s website stands out for its visuals, nevertheless the usability still has been thought of. This can be seen in the clarity of the top menu having two complete separate sections for the different users who enter the page (companies or candidates). The contact button and the different “call to actions”, which are really important, have been designed with distinctive characteristics like different colors to add contrast. Additionally, the efficient division of sections with areas of more and less important information has been perfectly executed and adds to the readability of the page. One of the only downsides of the page is that when resizing the viewport, the loading page reappears, making the experience rather uncomfortable at certain points.</p>

       <h3>• Technical</h3>
       <p>According to Speed Page Insights this website passes the Core Web Vitals Assessment on desktop but not on the mobile version, with the performance being one of the issues. In desktop the largest contentful paint and interaction to next paint passes, however in mobile the only test the web passes is the cumulative layout shift. Additionally by analyzing the code i have discovered the lack of a semantic html, all areas of the web are “div”. Nevertheless the website’s responsiveness functions and elements stay in place and readable. </p>

    <div class="analysis-text">
       <p>Elevate homescriptions is a home warranty that offers fast and reasonably priced home maintenance services.The website caught my attention because of the coherent visual style maintained throughout all pages of the site. Something that can be as stressful as choosing the warranty coverage for a house has been made amusing by taking in account the user experience. The friendly illustrations and relaxing colors add up to this experience.</p>

       <h3 class="3-analysis">• Structure</h3>
       <p>The site has an extremely organized structure divided into different pages, most of them are to learn information about the product they offer for different types of clients such as homeowners or realtors. However, the most striking aspect regarding the use of a coherent structure for a functional purpose is the homepage. It balances the use of informative illustrations with different elements that contribute to understanding what the company is and why the user should be a client. This can be seen with interactive carousels, impactful quotes, informative infographies and different call to actions. Additionally the website offers a floating chat for questions and a blog to inform possible clients.</p>

       <h3>• Visual</h3>
       <p>Elevate has a unique brand design that seems to be explored through different elements on the website. The color palette, made of different soft shades orange, green, yellow and blue takes in account the warm and cozy feelings they want the user to feel. Possibly one of the elements that does not perfectly match the simple style of the illustrations is the high contrast heading typography. The complexity of creating terminations of the glyphs hinders the readability in certain areas, especially when there are illustrations behind the text. Nevertheless the large quantity of beautiful illustrations and animations that explain the products they offer create a sense of friendliness in the company. One of the downsides, along with the issues with readability is the clearly AI generated photography. For a company that offers insurance, the use of pictures of not real people can make the user not trust the company, it would have been more appropriate to portray real humans.</p>

       <h3>• Interaction</h3>
       <p>The use of animations and microinteractions seems to be a focal point on this website. The homepage welcomes the user with an amusing animated illustration and that continues to be the case throughout the whole page. They not only contribute to the visual aesthetic, but they also keep a functional aspect. The creative hovering effects on buttons include the user in the experience and the delicate microinteractions when scrolling make the user want to discover more about the site.</p>

       <h3>• Usability</h3>
       <p>As I have already stated, the website has a rich visual style, however, the usability in certain pages of the site  is not one of its strengths, due to having certain incoherences. The homepage and the information page have an excessive amount of sections that seem to be repetitive and sometimes this makes the web lose graphic quality. Additionally, when scaling the viewport some texts and buttons overlap, making the website not completely responsive. When navigating to less important pages, such as the “request service” or the “order now” ones, the visual style completely changes and the website becomes hard to use because certain elements overlap.</p>

       <h3>• Technical</h3>
       <p>According to Speed Page Insights this Elevate homescriptions’ website does not pass Core Web Vitals Assessment neither on the desktop or the mobile version. Both the largest contentful paint and the interaction to next paint indicate that there has to be improvement. The code indicates that a non semantic language has been used on the majority of the page. Additionally to these facts, as I have stated before, the responsiveness of the page has not been completely executed so it advocates for readability.</p>

    <div class="analysis-text">
       <p>Composing is an infographic website that has the function of teaching about recycling with the aim to improve the quality of the ocean. What I absolutely admire about this page is how well they have managed to make a simple concept into an interesting piece or work full on interactions for the user. The whole scrolling interface seems like a joyful experience of learning how to make the planet a better place.</p>

       <h3 class="3-analysis">• Structure</h3>
       <p>The whole website consists of one unique page with a scrolling interface divided in separate sections of both written and visual information, in this case the lack of elements such as a menu or buttons to navigate, match the function on the website. It could be explained as if the use of continuous elements resemble the structure of a visual infographic.The first section has a bold welcoming message that by portraying certain smart illustrations guides the user to the next area. In some cases the scrolling is used to make carousels move, which leads the navigation to be smooth and effortless. The structure of the page completely changes on each section depending on the theme of the illustrations, creating a coherent theme throughout the page.</p>

       <h3>• Visual</h3>
       <p>The most important aspect of Composting’s website is the visual style. To begin with, the rough and distressed style of the illustrations match the organic concept the page is trying to translate. All these designs of food, houses, the ecosystem, etc help the user understand in a visual manner what the paragraphs of text are saying. This is the case for example with the infographic about what type of trash can be recycled and which one can not. The bold color used for the illustrations and its textures generate an effect of importance and make the elements stand out from others taking in account the contrast. Additionally, the organic, yet rough typography makes the user feel like being on this website is a friendly and amusing experience.</p>

       <h3>• Interaction</h3>
       <p>Alongside with the illustrations, the page has been structured using animations and microinteractions during the whole scrolling, this can be seen in backgrounds constantly moving to imitate nature or individual visual elements interacting with the headings. In this case, animations are not only a visual ornament but they contribute to the narrative and visually explain the concepts and ideas explained in the text. This can be seen for example in the trash being thrown out in the trash while scrolling, the compost cycle being a carousel with illustrations or even the water moving. </p>

       <h3>• Usability</h3>
       <p>The usability in the context of this website is different to analyse, because there are no buttons or menus to click on, due to the fact that it has been designed as an infographic website as I have stated before. Aside from that, the designers have made sure all texts, hearings and paragraphs are readable and are placed hierarchically. One of the only downsides is that in certain areas the text randomly changes font and size without any justification, making the design at certain points incongruent and difficult to read, leading to a distraction for the user.</p>

       <h3>• Technical</h3>
       <p>Regarding the technical aspects, according to PageSpeed Insights, the desktop version of the webpage passes the Core Web Vital Assessments and only has certain suggestions for the performance and accessibility. As well as the previously analysed websites, there is a lack of semantic html and an overuse of “div” sections. However responsiveness has been perfectly executed and the website maintains the readability and visual style in every possible viewport size, even with the great amount of illustrations.</p>

      <!-- JOY FROM AFRICA -->
      <section id="Joy from Africa">
        <h2>⁕ Joy From Africa</h2>
         <iframe src="https://www.joyfromafrica.co.za/" title="Joy from Africa" width="100%" height="400" loading="lazy"></iframe>
         <!-- Columns -->
  <div class="analysis-content">
  <!-- Text -->
    <div class="analysis-text">
       <p>Joy from Africa is a creative workshop and campaign originated in Cape Town, South Africa, with the aim to show the world the crafts, art and design they do there every year. The website has been made to showcase the story and where certain installations can be found around the city. The site has been beautifully crafted to match with the concept of a creative workshop. Additionally, all the visuals inspire feelings of tranquility and softness, making the user feel intrigued and inspired.</p>

       <h3 class="3-analysis">• Structure</h3>
       <p>The website structure is extremely complex and it is directly influenced by the positioning of the illustrations. The homepage gathers a collection of different illustrations placed in a carousel manner that invite the user to discover more with a subtle call to action button. From this starting point, by clicking in a certain area of the carousel the user navigates to a specific about page; the story, installations or the kids area. Possibly the most interesting one from a structure point of view is how the buttons to “learn more” in the installations page are placed inside the buildings in a Cape Town recreation. When clicking a pop up opens up with paragraph text and images placed in a scrolling manner. The “our story” page has been structured by integrating paragraph text with images placed along with the illustrations to simulate the unserious visual style of a website for a workshop.</p>

       <h3>• Visual</h3>
       <p>The branding of Joy from Africa is completely influenced by ornaments of elements that visually represent South Africa and the feeling of a manual workshop. The illustrations have been designed with both an aesthetic and functional purpose. Depending on the pase  illustrations are delicate representations of the vegetation from the country, or the more urban areas of the city. Nevertheless they maintain a coherent visual style that could be described as calm and warm. The color palette, that contains shades of green, blue, and warm tones complements the illustrations by creating a sense of belonging. The delicate and organic serif typography used in the headings symbolize the abundance of nature and ocean, which completely embody the brand values. </p>

       <h3>• Interaction</h3>
       <p>The user experience has been extremely valued by the designers and this can be seen in the amount of elements the user can interact with throughout the whole website. Firstly the homepage welcoming area, which is the starting point of navigation, has a carousel that activates its microinteractions when hovering. When clicking, the whole page becomes an animation that surrounds the user with dynamic illustrations while taking them to the next page. As I have mentioned before the “Our installations” page contains a whole interactive building with hidden buttons to find out more information. These interactions not only add to the user’s experience but are also a functional element to keep the user entertained and catch their attention to make them feel interested in the beautiful topic of African craftsmanship as a way to explore the culture. </p>

       <h3>• Usability</h3>
       <p>The purpose of the page is to be an interactive infographic that both informs a possible visitor or a person who wants to learn about the workshops. For that reason the usability has been made taking into account that the page is a linear experience. Nevertheless, at every point the user always knows which is the next step by adding buttons or arrows to easily guide the navigation. Every part of the website has been well thought of, promoting readability and high contrasting text. One of the downsides might be that the call to action buttons in the homepage carousel does not catch the user’s attention at first glance. However the softness of the visual style can justify this styling choice.</p>

       <h3>• Technical</h3>
       <p>In regard to the technical aspects and according to Speed Vitals, neither the desktop or the mobile version of the webpage passes the Core Web Vital, failing the first contentful paint, and the largest contentful paint. This indicates issues with the performance  of the page’s speed. As well as the other website the HTML has is non semantic, this can be justified by the lack of clear elements like a header or a footer. However, responsiveness for the mobile and desktop versions in this website has been carefully taken care of, meaning that there are no issues with the illustrations due to the viewport’s size in most cases.</p>
